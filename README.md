# Bonus project of *design of algorithm* course

**Graphical implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in java.**

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for *finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph*, which may represent, for example, road networks.

In my project you should *draw an polyon enviroment with mouse* then *specify number of obstacles and objects in enviroment and draw them*. finally you determine source and destination and my code draw all path and choose best of them. 

You can see an image of simple run:
